# Exploratory and Predictive Data Analysis

For this analysis you will use the road safety data available from here:
http://data.gov.uk/dataset/road-accidents-safety-data

### Description
These files provide detailed road safety data about the circumstances of personal injury road accidents in Great Britain, the types of vehicles involved and the consequential casualties. The statistics relate only to personal injury accidents on public roads that are reported to the police, and subsequently recorded, using the STATS19 accident reporting form.

### Task
The **purpose** of this analysis is:
- To summarize the main characteristics of the data, and obtain interesting facts that are worth highlighting.
- Identity and quantify associations (if any) between the number of casualities (in the Accidents table) and other variables in the data set.
- Explore whether it is possible to predict accident hotspots based on the data. 

The data analysis should **consist of** the following components:
1. A short description and justification of the steps taken.
2. Visualization and description of the data.
3. Performance and evaluations results of the predictive model.
4. Insights gained from the analysis.
