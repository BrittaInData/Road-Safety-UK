# Exploratory and Predictive Data Analysis

For this analysis you will use the road safety data available from here:
http://data.gov.uk/dataset/road-accidents-safety-data

### Description
The files provide detailed road safety data about the circumstances of personal injury road accidents in the UK, the types of vehicles involved and the consequential casualties. The statistics only relate to personal injury accidents on public roads that have been reported to the police, and subsequently recorded using the STATS19 accident reporting form. The files I have chosen to work with span the years 2013 to 2017.

### Task
The **purpose** of this analysis is:
- To summarize the main characteristics of the data, and obtain interesting facts that are worth highlighting.
- Identity and quantify associations (if any) between the number of casualities and other variables in the data set.
- Explore whether it is possible to predict accident hotspots based on the data.
